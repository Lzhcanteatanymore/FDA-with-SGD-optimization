This is a code that simulate a FDA analysis. I simulate a function, and use SGD algorithm to optimize the regression.

An important quality for this code is that I avoid using a p*p matrix to store the product of 2 basis functions matrixes. This will help to save the storage of computer chip.

You can easily adjust the parameters to fit your you needs.
